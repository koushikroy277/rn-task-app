Note: This is not a pure react native app. This app is made by using Expo-Cli which is a prototyping framework. So, in this app, you'll see a significant large bundle. For this reason, you will notice poor performance in this app and huge bundle size and assume that react native is a crap. Please, don't misunderstand this. This is just made for prototyping purpose not for any production. For production level, pure react native is recommended and it's performance is far better and the bundle size is tiny too.
